# Telos Method Research

**Date:** 2025-12-28
**Topic:** Dan Miessler's Telos Framework for Self-Knowledge

## Summary

Comprehensive research on Dan Miessler's Telos framework - an open-source method for creating "Deep Context" about what matters to humans.

## Key Findings

### What is Telos?
- **Creator:** Dan Miessler (October 2024)
- **Purpose:** Framework for articulating purpose, goals, and strategies that both humans and AI can understand
- **Philosophy:** Based on Aristotle's concept of telos (ultimate purpose) and eudaimonia (human flourishing)

### Core Framework Structure
```
Problems → Mission → Goals → Challenges → Strategies → Projects → Journal
```

### Key Insight
Every project you work on should trace back to a problem you care about solving. This provides transparency and explainability for all your actions.

### Why It Matters
In the AI age, execution is becoming commoditized. What differentiates you isn't *what* you do—it's *why* you do it.
